Keep lists of stuff you saw on some website you might want to buy later.

So far this app is just me playing with out it should work. It uses static data, but you get the idea of what it will be trying to do. I just wanted a convenient way to link people to a list of items that I thought were cool. Like when someone asks me for a recommendation for a backpack or a microphone or headphones or something.
